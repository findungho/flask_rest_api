# Create a simple REST API by using Python Flask

_This is a small back-end components in order to demonstrate the REST API by using Python Flask._

## Overview

A list of restaurants is an important element in Wolt app. Depending on where our customers are located, they will be able to order food from few dozen or even from hundreds of different restaurants. Views in the app (_Discovery, Search, Delivers, Nearby_) sort restaurants based on the delivery time, popularity, rating and various other factors when trying to find the most relevant matches for each customer.  

## Restaurant data

_restaurant.json_ contains fifty restaurants from central Helsinki area. Each object has a set fields providing more information about the restaurant, like _name_, _image_ and _location_. 

Example:

	{
		"city": "Helsinki",
		"currency": "EUR",
		"delivery_price": 390,
		"description": "Japanilaista ramenia parhaimmillaan",
		"image": "https://prod-wolt-venue-images-cdn.wolt.com/5d108aa82e757db3f4946ca9/d88ebd36611a5e56bfc6a60264fe3f81",
		"location": [
			24.941786527633663,
			60.169934599421396
		],
		"name": "Momotoko Citycenter",
		"online": false,
		"tags": [
			"ramen",
			"risotto"
		],
		"blurhash": "j2DUFG8jbu8AXuLIT5Tt0B01R2;;",
	}

Fields: 

- _city_ : A city where the restaurant is located (type: _string_)
- _currency_: ISO 4217 code of the currency the restaurant is using (type: _string_)
- _delivery price_: Delivery cost from the restaurant to a customer. The price is stored as subunits, so 390 in this case would be 3.90â‚¬ (type: _integer_)
- _description_: More information about what kind of restaurant it is (type: _string_)
- _image_: A link to restaurant's image (type: _string_)
- _location_: Restaurant's location in latitude & longitude coordinates. First element in the list is the longitude (type: a list containing two decimal elements)
- _name_: The name of the restaurant (type: _string_)
- _online_: If _true_, the restaurant is accepting orders at the moment. If _false_, then ordering is not possible (type: _boolean_)
- _tags_: A list of tags describing what kind of food the restaurant sells, e.g. pizza / burger (type: a list of strings, max.  3 elements)
- _blurhash_ : See [bonus task](#bonus)

## Backend - search
Create a REST API endpoint that allows searching restaurants. API needs to accept three parameters:
- _q_: query string. Full or partial match for the string is searched from _name_, _description_ and _tags_ fields. A minimum length for the query string is one character.
- _lat_: latitude coordinate (customer's location)
- _lon_ : longitude coordinate (customer's location)

API should return restaurant (objects) which **match the given query string** and are **closer than 3 kilometers** from coordinates. 

Example query:

	/restaurants/search?q=sushi&lat=60.17045&lon=24.93147
	
This search would return restaurants (in JSON format) which contain a word _sushi_ and are closer than 3km to the point [60.17045, 24.93147]. 

## How to run?
